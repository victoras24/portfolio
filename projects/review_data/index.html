          <p>In this project, I will attempt to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset that I collected from reviews of a famous local restaurant where I worked during the seasonal times while studying. As usual, I used Selenium to collect the dataset and then compiled the data into a single CSV using BeautifulSoup. Please check out the <a href="https://github.com/victoras24/sentiment_analysis/tree/main/data_collection">code</a> that I used to scrape and compile the review data from Trip Advisor. Lastly, I used Python in Jupyter notebooks to <a href="https://github.com/victoras24/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/data_processing/sentiment_cleaning.ipynb">clean</a>, process, analyze, and visualize the data along with the sentiment score that I extracted using the <a href="https://github.com/victoras24/sentiment_analysis/blob/main/data_processing/sentiment_cleaning.ipynb">Transformers Pipeline</a>.</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique that involves extracting subjective information from text data, such as opinions, attitudes, emotions, and feelings. It involves analyzing the text to determine whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. Sentiment analysis is widely used in various industries, including marketing, customer service, product development, and political analysis. By applying sentiment analysis to reviews of a local restaurant, we can gain insights into customers' experiences and opinions about the food, service, and ambiance, which can help the restaurant improve its offerings and increase customer satisfaction.</p>
          <p><br></p>
          <p>In this notebook, I will only demonstrate the process of analyzing and visualizing the data. If you want to explore the collection, cleaning, and extraction of sentiment scores using Transformers Pipeline, please check the links above.</p>

                Data analysis
            
            </h3>   
            
            <p><br></p>

            <p>

                For a warm-up, we can look at the dataset and read each column separately.
                
                <br>
                <br>

                The first question that comes to mind when looking at the data is: what is the count of reviews by star rating?

            </p>

            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

            <iframe width="700" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~fin17217/45.embed"></iframe>
            
            
            <img src="../../assets/count-stars.png" alt="Count stars">

            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

            <p>
                As we can see, the reviews mostly consist of 5 stars. As we move to lower star ratings, the number of reviews decreases. This indicates that, overall, the products/service has received mostly positive reviews. Let us now group the data into the sentiment for each year and plot it.
            </p>

            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

            <iframe width="1100" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~fin17217/47.embed"></iframe>

            <img src="../../assets/year-grouped.png" alt="">

            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

            <p>
                As shown in the plot above, there is no impact on the sentiment of the reviews due to COVID-19. However, we observe an increase in the number of negative reviews in 2022. We will investigate the reason behind the increase in negative comments in 2022. It is noteworthy that I was still working as a barman in 2022, and I hope there are no negative reviews for the cocktails. Additionally, in 2010, there were only 10 reviews, and half of them were negative. Therefore, there is no point in further investigating that year since there is not enough data.
            </p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p>
                Now, I want to group the sentiment by month and determine which months the clients are not as satisfied.
            </p>

            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

            <iframe width="1100" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~fin17217/49.embed"></iframe>
            
            <img src="../../assets/month-reviews.png" alt="">
            
            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

            <p>
                Allow me to explain why the reviews in the first and last months of the year are relatively lower compared to the spring and summer seasons. The restaurant operates from April to the end of October, which includes the Halloween period. Therefore, we observe an immediate increase in reviews during April, followed by a decrease in October. By plotting the data, we can clearly identify the months where review numbers decreased and determine if there are any months with a higher negative sentiment.
            </p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>We can observe that during the first four months when the restaurant is closed, there are little to no reviews. As the restaurant opens, the reviews gradually increase, peaking during the summer months. However, in October, the last month of operation, the review count immediately drops, and in November, there are no reviews. Although we can't identify the months with the highest negative reviews from the graph, we can calculate the percentage of negative reviews for each month and plot it to get a better understanding of the trend.</p>

            <p>

                By far, Mercedes is the brand that is being sold the most, as indicated by the plot I analyzed.
                This result suggests that Mercedes has a strong market presence and high consumer demand, possibly due to its reputation for luxury and quality. 
                However, it's worth noting that this conclusion is based on data from a specific car marketplace website and may not reflect the entire global market for cars.

            </p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p>

                I wanted to find out which transmission is the most commonly used among all the cars being sold. 
                Although I had an idea of the answer, I wanted to see a plot to better understand the difference. 

            </p>

            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

                <img class="pie-char" src="https://github.com/victoras24/portfolio/blob/main/assets/pie-chart.png?raw=true" alt="">

            </li>

        </ul>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <p>
            
            Based on the data, it's clear that the majority of cars sold (71.6%) have automatic transmissions, 
            while manual transmissions account for 28.2%. The remaining vehicles are those without gearboxes. 
            To determine whether the trend towards automatic transmissions is due to the popularity of newer cars, 
            we can conduct further analysis to see if most of the vehicles sold are relatively new. It's possible 
            that the high number of automatic transmissions could be attributed to both their ease of use and the 
            increased availability of these features in newer vehicles. Further investigation will give us a better 
            understanding of the driving factors behind this trend.

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <p>

            Most of the cars in our data are 10 years old, which could be a reason for having more automatic 
            transmissions than manual transmissions.

        </p>

        <p><br></p>

        <p>

            Lastly, I wanted to examine if there is any correlation between the number of kilometers driven and the price of a car

        </p>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <iframe width="1100" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plotly.com/~fin17217/42.embed"></iframe>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <p>

            I had to remove outliers that were affecting my analysis and plot. Some of the values for kilometers were displayed as extremely high, such as 1111111111 and 555555555. 
            So, to resolve this, I eliminated all kilometers values that were greater than 1 million.<p><br></p> <pre><code>drop_outliers = data_frame[data_frame['Km'] < 1000000]</code></pre> <img src="https://github.com/victoras24/portfolio/blob/main/assets/code1.png?raw=true" alt=""><p><br></p>
            
            <p>
                
                There is a negative correlation between the price and number of kilometers driven. Typically, more expensive cars have lower kilometers driven. However, there are some exceptions, such as a Mercedes with 400,000 kilometers driven and a price of 150,000. 
                I used the following query to gather more information about this specific car.
                <p><br></p> <pre><code>drop_outliers.query('Brand == "Mercedes-Benz" and Price == 155000 and Km == 400000')</code></pre>

            </p> 

            <p><br></p>

            <p>

                To conclude, I am wrapping up my first project on the analysis of car data collected from a marketplace 
                website. I have included a pairplot that you can explore to uncover interesting insights. Please check out 
                my Git repository to access the Jupyter notebook where I conducted data collection, export, cleaning, processing, and analysis.
