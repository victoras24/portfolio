          <p>This project explores the used car market in Cyprus through an analysis of data obtained from the country&apos;s most popular website for selling cars. The data was scraped using the library in Python named <a href="https://github.com/victoras24/car_data/blob/master/DataCollection/BazarakiScrab.ipynb"target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a> and includes information such as brand, model, year, engine type, fuel type, and location of the vehicles. The data was then compiled in a single sheet using <a href="https://github.com/victoras24/car_data/blob/master/DataCollection/MakingSoup.ipynb"target="_blank">BeautifulSoup</a> libary again and exported in .csv format. The data was also <a href="https://github.com/victoras24/car_data/blob/master/DataCleaning/SoupCleaning.ipynb"target="_blank">cleaned</a> by separating each piece of information into different columns and removing symbols, NaN values that could affect the analysis.
<p><br></p>

<p>Looking at the data, immediately some questions that I wanted to answer appeared.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>1. Which city has the highest number of car sales?</p>
<p>2. What are the best-selling brands?</p>
<p>3. Which type of transmission is most commonly used in each city?</p>
<p>4. Is there any correlation between (km) and price of a car?</p>
<p><br></p>

                Starting the <a href="https://github.com/victoras24/car_data/blob/master/DataAnalysis/Analysis.ipynb"target="_blank">analysis</a>, I wanted to make sure that the type of the numerical values is numeric or float. So I proceeded with changing the type of each numeric column to float or numeric. Now, we can start investigating the data. 
                
                <br>
                <br>

                First, let's find out which city has the highest number of car sales.

            </p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p>
                As you can see, Limassol has the most cars for sale and Famagusta has the least. 
                The population is certainly a criteria that puts Limassol 1st and Famagusta last. Now, let's find what is the mean price for each city.
            </p>

            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p>
                Looking at the plot, it is clear that Nicosia has a higher mean price than Limassol, 
                despite the fact that Limassol has more cars for sale as seen in the previous plot. This could 
                indicate greater competition among car dealers in Limassol, resulting in a larger supply of cars and 
                potentially lower prices. On the other hand, it could also reflect the different economic conditions in 
                the two cities, where Nicosia may have a stronger economy with higher demand for cars, leading to higher prices.
            </p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p>
                I wanted also to see what are the best selling brands. By analyzing this information, we can gain mini insights into consumer preferences and market trends.
            </p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p>
                Hmmmm, let's make a top ten list so we can have a clear overview of the plot and arrange it in descending order.
            </p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p>

                By far, Mercedes is the brand that is being sold the most, as indicated by the plot I analyzed.
                This result suggests that Mercedes has a strong market presence and high consumer demand, possibly due to its reputation for luxury and quality. 
                However, it's worth noting that this conclusion is based on data from a specific car marketplace website and may not reflect the entire global market for cars.

            </p>

            <p><br></p>

            <p>

                I wanted to find out which transmission is the most commonly used among all the cars being sold. 
                Although I had an idea of the answer, I wanted to see a plot to better understand the difference. 

            </p>

            <p><br></p>
            <p><br></p>

        <ul class="trans-count">    

            <li>

                <iframe width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plotly.com/~fin17217/29.embed"></iframe>
            
            </li>

            <li>

                <img src="https://github.com/victoras24/portfolio/blob/main/assets/trans-count.png?raw=true" alt="">
            
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <p>
            
            Based on the data, it's clear that the majority of cars sold (71.6%) have automatic transmissions, 
            while manual transmissions account for 28.2%. The remaining vehicles are those without gearboxes. 
            To determine whether the trend towards automatic transmissions is due to the popularity of newer cars, 
            we can conduct further analysis to see if most of the vehicles sold are relatively new. It's possible 
            that the high number of automatic transmissions could be attributed to both their ease of use and the 
            increased availability of these features in newer vehicles. Further investigation will give us a better 
            understanding of the driving factors behind this trend.

        </p>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <iframe width="1100" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plotly.com/~fin17217/40.embed"></iframe>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <p>

            Most of the cars in our data are 10 years old, which could be a reason for having more automatic 
            transmissions than manual transmissions.

        </p>

        <p><br></p>

        <p>

            Lastly, I wanted to examine if there is any correlation between the number of kilometers driven and the price of a car

        </p>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <iframe width="1100" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plotly.com/~fin17217/42.embed"></iframe>

        <p><br></p>
        <p><br></p>

        <p>

            I had to remove outliers that were affecting my analysis and plot. Some of the values for kilometers were displayed as extremely high, such as 1111111111 and 555555555. 
            So, to resolve this, I eliminated all kilometers values that were greater than 1 million.<p><br></p> <pre><code>drop_outliers = data_frame[data_frame['Km'] < 1000000]</code></pre><p><br></p>
            
            <p>
                
                There is a negative correlation between the price and number of kilometers driven. Typically, more expensive cars have lower kilometers driven. However, there are some exceptions, such as a Mercedes with 400,000 kilometers driven and a price of 150,000. 
                I used the following query to gather more information about this specific car.
                <p><br></p> <pre><code>drop_outliers.query('Brand == "Mercedes-Benz" and Price == 155000 and Km == 400000')</code></pre>

            </p> 

            <p><br></p>

            <p>

                To conclude, I am wrapping up my first project on the analysis of car data collected from a marketplace 
                website. I have included a pairplot that you can explore to uncover interesting insights. Please check out 
                my Git repository to access the Jupyter notebook where I conducted data collection, export, cleaning, processing, and analysis.
